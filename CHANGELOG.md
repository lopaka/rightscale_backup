rightscale_backup Cookbook CHANGELOG
=======================

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the rightscale_backup cookbook.

v1.1.0
------

- A `nickname` attribute is added which defaults to the value given in name attribute. This is useful if there are
  multiple resource actions on the same resource and the name needs to be unique.
- This cookbook now depends `rightscale_volume` and uses the `rightscale_volume` resource to restore a backup and
  does not rely on the Backups#restore API call.
- The filter used to search for backups now includes the `cloud_href` so it only searches for the backups on the
  current cloud.
- The test-rightscale_backup cookbook omits the boot disks attached on Google servers.

v1.0.1
------

- Pull Request [#4][]: Skip the boot disk on gce during backup create action
- Added ChefSpec matchers

v1.0.0
------

- Initial release
